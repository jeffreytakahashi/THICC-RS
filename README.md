# THICC-RS
The Homemade Integral Code Collection, Reed-Solomon

This is to be a C implementation of a Reed-Solomon error correction. Code is based on the project found 
at https://github.com/Backblaze/JavaReedSolomon. The work here is intended to provide a faster final
product than the original Java implementation built by BackBlaze.

This final goal is to produce a functional C implementation of the repo found above. This is  to be
used by the Portland State Aerospace Society's (PSAS) OreSat team.
